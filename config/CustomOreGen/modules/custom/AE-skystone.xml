<!--*************************  CustomOreGen Configuration **********************>
*
*   CustomOreGen allows you to customize the generation of Ore within
*   your worlds. This file contains a list of "distributions", which
*   place a specific block according to a specific
*   algorithm.  You can have as many distributions as you want, including
*   multiple distributions for the same block type.
*   
*   There are four basic algorithms available:
*   "StandardGen", "Susbstitute", "Veins", and "Cloud".
*
*   This file is written in XML.
*   Many names and values are ***CASE SENSISTIVE***.
